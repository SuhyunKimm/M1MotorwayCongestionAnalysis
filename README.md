# M1 Motorway Traffic Congestion Analysis

## ðŸ“ŒProject Overview
This project started with a simple question: "<em><b>Why is there always traffic?</em></b>"-a thought that crossed my mind on a sunny afternoon at 2PM while stuck in congestion on the M1 motorway near Coomera.<br><br>
The M1 has long been notorious for its heavy traffic, and congestion has only worsened over the past five years. Even with careful planning and awareness of expected traffic conditions, unpredictable delays still occur.
Even though you had prepared the expected traffic, sometimes it doesn't work that way.

Determined to uncover the reasons behind this persistent congestion, I decided to analyze traffic patterns on the M1 motorway.
This project aims to identify key congestion factors, examine external influences such as weather and fuel prices, and provide insights through data analysis and visualization.
